# Basic Hang-Man
## uses only vanilla js, html and css.


Hello, thank you for looking at my hangman project. I started this as an assignment for one of those 12 week coding boot camps and never was able to finish it. The boot camp thin just didn't work out. I had pretty much given up on coding and a few months went by. I started looking into other learning options. I found [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com). Its all free with the some dedicated folks to help learners. I started going through it and with the past boot camp experience I started picking up on things just a little better. It helps when you go at your own pace and spend how ever long you want to on js basics instead of being rushed on to React or Angular or some other thing. Anyway after about 3 weeks I completed the web developer 101 section and felt compelled to come back to this assignment. It still isn't beautiful but it is fully functional. It greets the player by name, keeps track of incorrect guesses and only allows for a set number of them, it alerts winning or loosing, shows guessed letters as they are guessed. If you want to use this for an assignment please please just change some variable names and then go track them all down in the rest of the code where they are being used. That will at least get you going. This isnt without issue however, I will be making a list bug fixes and feel freee to submit one or a pull request to fix something. Happy coding and hang in there!!!
